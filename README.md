# WIP: Excoverage

A tool for calculating test coverage using ExUnit for running tests.
For now it calculates function coverage only.

To do:

  - calculating line & branch coverage
  - integration with hex.pm

## Installation

TODO:
The package can be installed by adding `excoverage` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:excoverage, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Documentation

The docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/excoverage](https://hexdocs.pm/excoverage).
